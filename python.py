# This file goes over some fundamental basic programming concepts.


# Variables let you store information. Unlike other languages you don't need to specify the type (string, int, double)

#these are both type str (for string). they must be surrounded by quotes
word = "word"
sentence = "this is a sentence!"

#this is an int. (integer) it has to be a whole number and can be positive or negative.
num = 3

#this is a double. it can have decimal points and alsp be positive or negative
another_num = 5.5



# The 'print' function prints output to the screen with a newline on the end
print("Hello world")


#you can to operations on numbers and assign the solution to a variable or print it.
print("the solution of 5 + 3 is")
print(5 + 3)

subtraction = 7 - 2
print("this number is " + str(subtraction))
